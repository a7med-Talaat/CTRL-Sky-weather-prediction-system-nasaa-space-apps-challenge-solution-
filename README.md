# üõ∞Ô∏è CTRL + Sky: NASA GES DISC Weather Explorer

**CTRL + Sky** is an advanced, AI-powered weather prediction system built to analyze historical patterns and forecast future conditions for any global location. It leverages simulated data access from **NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC)** and modern machine learning techniques, all presented in a sleek, interactive, space-themed web application.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Advanced AI-Powered Prediction Engine

The core application provides sophisticated weather analysis and prediction based on location and date.

* **Global Location Analysis:** Select any point on the **interactive Leaflet map** or use the **Nominatim Geocoding search**.
* **Historical Data Integration:** Simulates analysis of historical weather patterns from **NASA GES DISC datasets** (e.g., MERRA-2, GPCP) and a Kaggle Global Temperatures Dataset, allowing selection of a data training range (5 to 30 years).
* **Multi-Model Prediction:** For future dates, the system utilizes one of four simulated advanced AI models:
    * **Basic Climate Model**
    * **Machine Learning Model** (Simulated Neural Network)
    * **Hybrid AI Model** (Combines multiple approaches)
    * **Ensemble Model (Advanced):** Includes **Monte Carlo Simulation** and **Bayesian Updating** for highly accurate predictions with uncertainty quantification.
* **Detailed Prediction Metrics:** Provides key performance indicators for predictions, including the **Confidence Score**, **Error Margin (¬∞C)**, **Model Accuracy (%)**, and **Training Time (ms)**.

### 2. Interactive Visualization & Analysis

Results are presented with a focus on scientific detail and clarity.

* **Probability Analysis:** Displays the likelihood of five key weather states in a **Radar Chart** and visually engaging probability circles: **Clear Skies, Cloudy, Very Windy, Very Wet,** and **Uncomfortable (Extreme Temperatures)**.
* **Temperature Trend Chart:** Visualizes long-term temperature trends, including average, maximum, and minimum recorded temperatures and the overall climate change over the selected range.
* **Analysis Summary & Data Preview:** Provides a concise, natural-language summary of the AI model's findings and a toggleable, structured **JSON preview** of the raw prediction data and model metrics.
* **Data Download:** Allows users to download the full prediction data in **CSV** and **JSON** formats.

### 3. Engaging "Weather Personality" Game

A fun, interactive quiz to personalize the user experience and connect them with the weather data.

* **7-Question Quiz:** Answers are scored to determine which of the four seasons matches the user's weather preferences.
* **Personalized Results:** Displays a detailed "Season Personality" with an icon, title, description, and key traits.
